        <p>Blackened Chicken and Uncle Ben's Rice is one of my favourite post-workout dinners. Succulent, and filled with protein needed to recover your muscles, you'll never get bored of such a delicious and tasty meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       
    <h4>Blackened Chicken</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Chicken Breast, halved</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Spices <i>(Cajun, Paprika, Garlic Powder, Cayenne Pepper.)</i></li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Uncle Ben's Rice</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Uncle Ben's Rice Packet (Any flavour, I prefer 'Savoury Chicken')</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Water</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2> 

    <h4>Blackened Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season Chicken well with Salt and Spices and leave to dry brine for at least 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat frying pan, add the Oil, lay the Breast away from you and leave to cook on a medium-high heat for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip Chicken over and allow to cook for 3 minutes on the other side.</li>
        <li>Allow to rest on a wire rack, so as to not let the Chicken Breast get soggy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Uncle Ben's Rice</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Break up the Rice in the packet with your hands.</li>
        <li>Open the Packet and empty Rice in to a pan. Set the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp of boiling water and cover the pan with a lid.</li>
        <li>Let Rice simmer until water mostly evaporates and then stir thoroughly.</li>
    </ol>
