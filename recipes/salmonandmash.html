    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Mashed Potatoes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg Potatoes, <em>preferably Jack Russets</em></li>
            <li>250ml Milk</li>
            <li>50g Butter, <i>more to garnish</i></li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Vegetable Medley</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Seasonal Vegetables, <i>e.g. Parsnip, Carrots</i></li>
            <li>A drizzle of Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Pan-Seared Salmon</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 salmon fillets <em>with skin</em></li>
            <li>Sunflower Oil, <i>or any other Oil with a high smoke point.</i></li>
            <li>Salt, Pepper & Lemon to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2> 
    <h4>Mashed Potatoes</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the Potatoes and submerge them in water to slow down oxidation.</li>
        <li>Cut the Potatoes into roughly 2 inch sized cubes and fill a pan with lightly-salted water.</li>
        <li>Put the Potatoes in a pan and bring to a boil, then leave to simmer for 15-25 minutes. <i>You'll know they're ready if you prod them with a knife and it slips off gently!</i></li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Warm the Milk and melt the Butter in seperate saucepans and combine in to a large mixing bowl with the potatoes. Add seasoning as required.</li>
        <li>Mash well using a fork, or a potato masher until all ingredients are combined.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Vegetable Medley</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the Oven to 230 Degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Prep the Vegetables at hand by cutting in to small strips and chunks.</li>
        <li>Season well, add a drizzle of Olive Oil and toss thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Put Vegetables in the Oven, and allow to Roast for roughly 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pan-Seared Salmon</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 2-3 tablespoons of Oil to coat the surface of the pan/skillet and then pre-heat until the oil shimmers and there is a light smoke emanating from the pan. <i>(I prefer using a cast-iron skillet as it retains heat well!)</i></li>
        <li>Lay the Salmon Fillet skin-side-down away from you on a medium heat for 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently pry the salmon side to side with tongs until it breaks free from the bottom of the pan and flip it over to cook for another 2-3 minutes. <i>Internal temperature should reach ~130 Degrees Celsius.</i></li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining fillets and allow to rest on a wire rack whilst plating the other ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
